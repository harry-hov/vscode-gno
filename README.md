## Feature highlights

* [Syntax highlighting] - Syntax highlighting for Gno files
* [Formatting] - Automatically apply [gofumpt](https://github.com/mvdan/gofumpt) formatting on save
* [Transpile] - Transpile uses [gno](https://github.com/gnolhttps://github.com/gnolang/gno/tree/master/gnovm/cmd/gno). `gno` needs to be installed for this feature to work.
* [Test] - Test *_test.gno and *_filetest.gno files. Uses [gno](https://github.com/gnolhttps://github.com/gnolang/gno/tree/master/gnovm/cmd/gno) and `gno` needs to be installed for this feature to work.
* [Snippets] - Templates that make it easier to enter repeating code patterns, such as loops or conditional-statements.
* [Code Lens] - Enables CodeLens for *_test.gno and *_filetest.gno files.
* [Diagnostics] -  Build and lint errors shown as you type or on save. Needs language server(`gnopls`) to be enabled.
* [Mod Init] -  Create `gno.mod` file.
* [Publish Package] - Publish Gno package/realm to the chain. [`gnokey`](https://github.com/gnolang/gno/tree/master/gno.land/cmd/gnokey) needs to be installed for this feature to work.
* [Clean Generated Files] - Cleans generated Go(`*.gno.gen.go`) files.
